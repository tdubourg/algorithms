== Algorithms ==

This repo holds various implementations of various useful aglorithms. From very
naive / standard ones to more complex ones (see in particular the "puzzles"
folder, with NP-Complete problems, among others).

It is not aimed to anything other than providing an example of ways to solves
those kind of problems and understand standard algorithms.
